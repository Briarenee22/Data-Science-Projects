# Loan Prediction Model 
#### About the dataset
This dataset, sourced from Kaggle's loan prediction challenge, contains structured data from the financial domain, focusing on loan applicants. It includes both numerical and categorical features such as income, education, employment status, credit history, and loan status, making it ideal for data analysis and machine learning. The data is likely collected automatically from loan application records, reflecting real-world financial processes. I chose this dataset to explore the key factors influencing loan approval decisions, as it provides valuable insights for financial institutions and offers practical experience with data cleaning, analysis, and predictive modeling.
