# Loan Prediction Model 
#### About the dataset
This dataset, sourced from Kaggle's loan prediction challenge, contains structured data from the financial domain, focusing on loan applicants. It includes both numerical and categorical features such as income, education, employment status, credit history, and loan status, making it ideal for data analysis and machine learning. The data is likely collected automatically from loan application records, reflecting real-world financial processes. I chose this dataset to explore the key factors influencing loan approval decisions. I am analyzing these features to identify patterns and trends that influence loan approval status and to develop a predictive model to better understand the factors that lead to loan acceptance or rejection.
